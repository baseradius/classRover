arduino based line follower that goes around classrooms in a school and rings bells and stuff

A gigantic line follower - has 5 line sensors, a few buttons and will have a keypad and maybe an LCD screen or 2 7 segment displays..

Uses at the moment an Arduino Uno but maybe upgraded to a Mega to account for so many GPIO pin usages.

Testing the whole local and remote git thing - my first time, surprisingly!
